# Convpot

Convpot is a converter program written in C++ which converts raw data from potentiostats into a sqlite database ready to be plotted by [plotpot.py](https://github.com/ahpohl/plotpot). Convpot is automatically called by plotpot.py, but can also be called on its own for example to merge files.
